# equalizing-chess
Equalizing chess allows you to play against stockfish in such a way that it does not try to beat you with all its strength, but rather balance the game with each move to try to keep the evaluation as balanced as possible.

NOTE: this project is in early development state. The code will be published in march (2024)
